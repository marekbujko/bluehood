## Why?

This project was inspired by the [WhisperPair vulnerability](https://whisperpair.eu/) ([CVE-2025-36911](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-36911)), which highlighted privacy risks in Bluetooth devices.

Thousands of Bluetooth devices surround us at all times: phones, cars, TVs, headphones, hearing aids, delivery vehicles, and more. Bluehood demonstrates how simple it is to passively detect these devices and observe patterns in their presence.

With enough data, you could potentially:
- Understand what time someone typically walks their dog
- Detect when a visitor arrives at a house
- Identify patterns in daily routines based on device presence

This metadata can reveal surprisingly personal information without any active interaction with the devices.

**Bluehood is an educational tool to raise awareness about Bluetooth privacy.** It's a weekend project, but the implications are worth thinking about.

## What?

Bluehood is a Bluetooth scanner that:

- **Continuously scans** for nearby Bluetooth devices (both BLE and Classic)
- **Identifies devices** by vendor (MAC address lookup) and BLE service UUIDs
- **Classifies devices** into categories (phones, audio, wearables, IoT, vehicles, etc.)
- **Tracks presence patterns** over time with hourly/daily heatmaps
- **Filters out noise** from randomized MAC addresses (privacy-rotated devices)
- **Analyzes device correlations** to find devices that appear together
- **Sends push notifications** when watched devices arrive or leave
- **Provides a web dashboard** for monitoring and analysis

## Features

### Scanning
- Dual-mode scanning: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Classic Bluetooth
- MAC address vendor lookup (local database + online API fallback)
- BLE service UUID fingerprinting for accurate device classification
- Classic Bluetooth device class parsing
- Randomized MAC filtering (hidden from main view)

### Device Management
- Mark devices as "Watched" for tracking personal devices
- Organize devices into custom groups
- Set friendly names for known devices
- Add custom notes/tags to any device
- Device type detection (phones, audio, wearables, IoT, vehicles, etc.)

### Analytics
- **30-day presence timeline** visualization
- **Signal strength (RSSI) history** chart with 7-day data
- **Hourly and daily activity heatmaps** showing when devices are active
- **Pattern analysis** ("Weekdays, evenings 5PM-9PM")
- **Dwell time analysis** showing total time devices spend in range
- **Device correlation** detection to find devices that appear together
- **Proximity zones** (immediate, near, far, remote) based on signal strength
- Search by MAC, vendor, or name
- Date range search for historical queries

### Notifications (via ntfy.sh)
- Push notifications to your phone/desktop
- Notify when new devices are detected
- Notify when watched devices return
- Notify when watched devices leave
- Configurable thresholds for arrival/departure

### Web Interface
- **Compact/Detailed view toggle** for different display preferences
- **Screenshot mode** to obfuscate MACs and names for safe sharing
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users (press `?` to view)
- **CSV export** of device data
- **Device groups** for organizing related devices
- **Optional authentication** to secure access

## How?

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

> **Prerequisites — Linux hosts only**
>
> Bluehood communicates with your Bluetooth adapter via BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth stack. **BlueZ must be installed and running on the host before starting the container** — the Docker image itself does not include it.
>
> ```bash
> # Debian / Ubuntu (including Ubuntu Server)
> sudo apt install bluez
> sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
>
> # Arch Linux
> sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
> sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
> ```
>
> Without BlueZ on the host you'll see an error like:
> `BLE scan error: [org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown] The name org.bluez was not provided by any .service files`

```bash
# Create a docker-compose.yml or download the one from this repo
# Then start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

The Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry:

```
ghcr.io/dannymcc/bluehood:latest
```

The web dashboard will be available at **http://localhost:8080**

#### Docker Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Linux host with Bluetooth adapter
- BlueZ installed and running on the host (`sudo apt install bluez && sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth`)

> **Note**: Docker runs in privileged mode with host networking for Bluetooth access. This is required for BLE scanning.

#### Docker Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BLUEHOOD_ADAPTER` | auto | Bluetooth adapter (e.g., `hci0`) |
| `BLUEHOOD_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Database storage directory |

### Manual Installation (Linux)

```bash
# Install system dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils python-pip

# Install system dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install bluez python3-pip

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood.git
cd bluehood
pip install -e .
```

#### Bluetooth Permissions

Bluetooth scanning requires elevated privileges. Choose one:

1. **Run as root** (simplest):
   ```bash
   sudo bluehood
   ```

2. **Grant capabilities to Python**:
   ```bash
   sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+eip' $(readlink -f $(which python))
   bluehood
   ```

3. **Use systemd service** (recommended for always-on):
   ```bash
   sudo cp bluehood.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now bluehood
   ```

### macOS

Bluehood works natively on macOS without Docker. macOS uses CoreBluetooth instead of BlueZ, which is handled automatically by the `bleak` library.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dannymcc/bluehood.git
cd bluehood

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install
pip install -e .

# Run
python -m bluehood.daemon
```

The web dashboard will be available at **http://localhost:8080**

> **Note**: On first run, macOS will prompt you to allow Bluetooth access. You must grant this permission for scanning to work.

## Usage

```bash
# Start with web dashboard (default port 8080)
bluehood

# Specify a different port
bluehood --port 9000

# Use a specific Bluetooth adapter
bluehood --adapter hci1

# List available adapters
bluehood --list-adapters

# Disable web dashboard (scanning only)
bluehood --no-web
```

## Web Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

- **Device list** with type icons, vendor, MAC, name, sightings, last seen
- **Device filters** by type (phones, audio, IoT, etc.) and watched status
- **Search** by MAC, vendor, or name
- **Date range search** to find devices seen in a specific time window
- **Settings** for configuring notifications, groups, and authentication
- **Device details** modal with:
  - BLE service fingerprints
  - Hourly/daily activity heatmaps
  - 30-day presence timeline
  - Signal strength (RSSI) history chart
  - Pattern analysis
  - Dwell time statistics
  - Correlated devices list
  - Proximity zone indicator
  - Operator notes field
  - Group assignment

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Focus search bar |
| `r` | Refresh device list |
| `c` | Toggle compact view |
| `w` | Toggle watch on selected device |
| `Esc` | Close modal |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |

### Screenshot Mode

Enable screenshot mode from the sidebar to obfuscate sensitive data before sharing screenshots:
- MAC addresses show only first 2 octets (e.g., `AA:BB:XX:XX:XX:XX`)
- Friendly names show only first 2 characters (e.g., `Da********`)
- CSV exports also respect screenshot mode

## Push Notifications

Bluehood can send push notifications via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh), a free, open-source notification service.

1. Create a topic at ntfy.sh (e.g., `bluehood-myname-alerts`)
2. Subscribe to the topic on your phone using the ntfy app
3. In Bluehood settings, enter your topic name and enable notifications
4. Configure which events trigger notifications:
   - New device detected
   - Watched device returns (after being absent)
   - Watched device leaves (not seen for X minutes)

## Data Storage

Data is stored in `~/.local/share/bluehood/bluehood.db` (SQLite).

Override location with environment variables:
- `BLUEHOOD_DATA_DIR` - Directory for data files
- `BLUEHOOD_DB_PATH` - Direct path to database file

## How It Works

### Device Classification

Bluehood classifies devices using multiple signals (in priority order):

1. **BLE Service UUIDs** - Most accurate (Heart Rate = wearable, A2DP = audio, etc.)
2. **Device name patterns** - "iPhone", "Galaxy", "AirPods", etc.
3. **Vendor OUI lookup** - Apple, Samsung, Bose, etc.

### Randomized MACs

Modern devices randomize their MAC addresses for privacy. Bluehood:
- Detects randomized MACs (locally administered bit)
- Hides them from the main device list (not useful for tracking)
- Shows a count of hidden randomized devices

### Pattern Analysis

Bluehood analyzes sighting timestamps to detect patterns:

- **Time of day**: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night
- **Day of week**: Weekdays, Weekends
- **Frequency**: Constant, Daily, Regular, Occasional, Rare

Example patterns: "Daily, evenings (5PM-9PM)", "Weekdays, morning (8AM-12PM)"

### Device Correlation

Bluehood detects devices that frequently appear together within a configurable time window. This can reveal:
- Devices owned by the same person (phone + smartwatch)
- People who travel together
- Devices that share a schedule

### Proximity Zones

Based on RSSI signal strength, devices are classified into proximity zones:
- **Immediate** (> -50 dBm): Very close, within a few meters
- **Near** (-50 to -60 dBm): Nearby, same room
- **Far** (-60 to -70 dBm): Further away, adjacent rooms
- **Remote** (< -70 dBm): Distant, at edge of detection range

### Dwell Time Analysis

Tracks how long devices spend in range by analyzing gaps between sightings. A configurable gap threshold (default 15 minutes) determines when a new "session" begins.

## Troubleshooting

### No devices found
- Ensure Bluetooth adapter is enabled: `bluetoothctl power on`
- Check adapter is detected: `bluehood --list-adapters`
- Run with sudo if permission denied

### Docker issues

**`BLE scan error: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown` / `The name org.bluez was not provided`**

BlueZ is not installed or not running on the host. Fix:
```bash
sudo apt install bluez          # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
docker compose restart
```

**General checklist:**
- Ensure BlueZ is installed on the **host** (not just in the container)
- Verify Bluetooth service is running: `systemctl status bluetooth`
- Confirm your adapter is visible: `bluetoothctl list`
